# Choices

On this page, I will explain some choices I made as an F.A.Q

### Why do I use cloud services ?

- Email system is a headhache (blacklist/whitelist etc...) and I don't want to invest time into it
- Offsite backup (s3 buckets)
- Disaster recovery, offsite monitoring

### Why did I choose T-bao MN58U as a server ?

I've replaced my old servers (R320, Homemade with R7 2700) to reduce electricity costs.
This server uses only 15W to operate. It is small and doesn't make any noises, and it still has a pretty decent processor with 32Gb RAM.

### Why I'm using cloud european services ?

My conviction regarding GAFAM and GDPR.

### Why do I have an Oracle VPS ?

Because this VPS is completely Free with disk encryption otherwise I would have used probably Hetzner like in the past.
